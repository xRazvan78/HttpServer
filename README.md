# HTTP Server from Scratch (Python)

A minimal HTTP/1.1 server implemented from scratch using raw TCP sockets in Python.
No web frameworks and no built-in HTTP server libraries are used.

The purpose of this project is to understand how web servers and frameworks work internally,
including request parsing, routing, and concurrency.

- Basic routing system
- Concurrent request handling
- Simple static file serving
